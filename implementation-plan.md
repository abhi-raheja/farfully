- [x] Create API service layer with both mock and real data
- [x] Set up state management for columns with Zustand
- [ ] Implement basic feed viewing functionality
- [ ] Create post composer and editor
- [ ] Implement draft saving functionality
- [ ] Build post scheduling system
- [ ] Add real-time updates
- [ ] Create user settings and preferences
- [ ] Implement responsive design
- [ ] Add analytics features
- [ ] Test and deploy

## Phase 1: Setup and Foundation (COMPLETED)
- [x] Set up Next.js project with TypeScript
- [x] Create mock authentication module as a placeholder for Farcaster AuthKit
  - *Note: Full AuthKit integration will be implemented in Phase 2 after we set up proper API integration*
  - *Current mock login works for development purposes*
- [x] Implement basic API service layer with mock data
- [x] Create basic project structure (directories, configuration files)
- [x] Set up basic styling with Tailwind CSS

## Phase 2: Data Fetching Layer (IN PROGRESS)
- [x] Install Farcaster AuthKit for authentication
- [x] Set up environment configuration for API keys and settings
- [x] Create Neynar API client adapter for Farcaster
- [x] Implement hybrid API service layer that works with both mock and real data
- [x] Set up Zustand for state management (column configuration)
- [ ] Implement column component for data display
- [ ] Create data models and interfaces
- [ ] Set up real-time data subscriptions
- [ ] Test API integrations

## Phase 3: UI Framework
- [ ] Design and implement responsive layout system
- [ ] Create column component with customization options
- [ ] Build basic feed rendering components
- [ ] Create drag-and-drop column management
- [ ] Implement column settings and configuration

## Phase 4: Post Creation & Scheduling
- [ ] Create post editor interface with formatting options
- [ ] Implement draft saving functionality in database
- [ ] Build scheduling system with background jobs
- [ ] Add media upload capabilities
- [ ] Implement calendar view for scheduled posts

## Phase 5: Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement notification support
- [ ] Add analytics dashboard for post performance
- [ ] Create user settings for preferences
- [ ] Add thread creation capabilities

## Phase 6: Testing and Deployment
- [ ] Implement comprehensive testing
- [ ] Optimize performance and accessibility
- [ ] Set up production deployment pipeline

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
Phase 2 is in progress. We have implemented the core API service layer with Neynar SDK integration, set up the authentication framework with AuthKit, and created a Zustand store for managing column configurations. Next, we will focus on creating the UI components for displaying feeds and column management.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
The implementation of the Farcaster API service is now complete with both mock and real data retrieval options. The mock implementation provides a reliable fallback for development and in case of API errors or rate limiting. The Neynar SDK has some inconsistencies between its documentation and actual implementation, so I've had to make some adaptations to get it working properly.

I've also implemented the basic structure for Farcaster AuthKit integration, but there are some challenges with the API that we'll need to work through in the next phase. For now, we're using a hybrid approach that allows both mock and real authentication.

## Lessons
- Farcaster documentation is available at https://docs.farcaster.xyz/
- There are multiple ways to access Farcaster data:
  1. Use Neynar API (managed service, easiest integration)
  2. Connect to Hubble instances (more direct, requires more setup)
  3. Use client libraries like farcaster-js or hub-nodejs
- AuthKit provides React components and hooks for SIWF implementation
- Projects like thirdweb-siwf demonstrate how to integrate Farcaster auth with web apps
- Ketchup is an existing solution for Farcaster post scheduling that we can learn from
- For post scheduling, we'll need to implement a background job system to handle the publishing at scheduled times
- TweetDeck-like UIs should consider virtual scrolling for performance when displaying many posts
- The "Spool" project provides a good reference for a TweetDeck-like layout for another platform (Threads)
- Creating mock implementations first allows for faster development without waiting for external services 
- Always verify the current working directory before executing commands to ensure you're in the correct project folder
- Neynar API documentation can be difficult to navigate - their TypeScript SDK has differences from what's documented
- FarcasterAuthKit requires careful implementation - need to follow their examples precisely
- Using a state management solution like Zustand makes it easy to persist column configurations
